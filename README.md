This dataset is taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset).
The SQL queries conducted on the Healthcare database provided comprehensive insights into various facets of patient demographics, medical conditions, treatments, financial aspects, and hospital performances. These findings facilitate informed decision-making processes and offer valuable insights for healthcare management and analysis.
**DATA OVERVIEW**
  - The dataset was explored to gather a comprehensive view of patient information and healthcare records. Queries included counting total records, finding the maximum and average ages of hospitalized patients, and analyzing patient demographics based on age.
**Medical Conditions & Medication**
  - Detailed insights were derived regarding prevalent medical conditions, medications prescribed for specific conditions, and the frequency of their occurrence. This information assists in understanding the distribution and treatment of various health issues within the dataset.
**Insurance Providers & Hospoitals**
  - The project delved into patient preferences for insurance providers and hospitals based on frequency. This data aids in resource allocation, understanding coverage preferences, and evaluating the prominence of healthcare services across different facilities.
**Financial Analysis & Duration Of Hospitalization**
   - Financial aspects were scrutinized by examining average billing amounts associated with different medical conditions and calculating the total billing amount and duration of hospital stays for patients across various hospitals. This helps in understanding costs, hospital efficiency, and patient care duration.
**Blood Type Analysis & Donation Matching**
- The distribution of blood types among patients was explored, highlighting potential correlations between age groups and blood type occurrences. Additionally, a stored procedure, 'Blood_Matcher,' was created to identify potential donors and recipients based on specific criteria of blood types, age, and hospital affiliation or non-affiliation.
**Yearly Addmission & Insurance Analysis**
  - The analysis extended to identifying hospitals with patient admissions in specific years (2024 and 2025) and understanding billing patterns across different insurance providers. This aids in understanding patient inflow trends and disparities in billing practices among insurance companies.
